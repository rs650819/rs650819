'''so then we are adding NaOH in dropwise manner upto the penaltimate addition of NaOH to equivalence
the reason behind this  is when we start addition of NaOH dropwise manner
there is both AcOH and AcO- in the solution that will form a buffer now
the PH of a buffer can be given by Hendersonequation but at equvalence theree is no AcOH left 
and later we will use salt hydrolysis of AcO- to find the PH at equivalence point '''

# in each step we ar adding 2 drops of NaOH 0.1 ml
# NaOH volume is started from 0.1

#stepbasecon is actually the [AcO-] fromed after each addition of NaOH as before equivalence point [OH-]=[AcO-] 
stepacidcon=((con_acid*vol_acid)-(base_added*con_base))/(base_added+vol_acid) ##?
# stepacidcon is the [AcOH] left after each additon of NaOH
# we are going to use the henderson equation from the 1st two drop addition of NaOH to the penaltimate addition of NaOH
# here it wii form a buffer 
# like HA + H2o = A- + H3O+
