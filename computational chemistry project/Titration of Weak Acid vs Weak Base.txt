''' so then we are adding NH4OH in dropwise manner uoto the penaltimate addition of NH4OH to acid solution
The reason behind this is when we start addition of NH4OH dropwise manner.There is both AcOH and AcO-
in the solution that will form a buffer now the pH of a buffer can be given by
Henderson equation but at the equivalent point there is no AcOH and later we will
use salt hydrolysis of AcO- to find the pH at the equivalent point.During the progress
of neutralization before the equivalent point,the pH of the solution changes more or less 
in the same fashion as in the titration of AcOH and NH4OH.'''
